# Online Raithu Bazaar - Progress Report

## Project Overview
Online Raithu Bazaar is an eCommerce mobile application designed to connect farmers directly with consumers. The platform aims to empower farmers by streamlining the selling process while providing consumers with a transparent buying experience.

## Current Progress

### Authentication System ✅
- Successfully implemented login and signup screens
- Integrated with backend API endpoints:
  - Login: `https://api.letsfindaway.online/auth/log-in`
  - Signup: `https://api.letsfindaway.online/auth/sign-up`
- Created persistent authentication using `AsyncStorage`
- Implemented form validation and error handling
- **Pending Enhancement**: Role-based authentication for farmers and consumers

### Navigation Structure ✅
- Set up tab-based navigation for the main app
- Implemented authentication flow with protected routes
- Created conditional rendering based on authentication state
- Fixed navigation issue between login and signup screens by replacing Link component with direct router navigation

### Home Screen ✅
- Developed a simple welcome screen that shows user information
- Added logout functionality

## Recent Fixes

### Navigation from Login to Signup ✅
Previously, clicking on the "Sign Up" button in the login screen showed a "screen doesn't exist" error. This issue has been fixed by:

1. Replacing the Expo Router `Link` component with a direct `router.push()` navigation
2. Using the full path `/auth/signup` instead of the relative path `signup`

```typescript
// Old code with issue
<Link href="signup" asChild>
  <TouchableOpacity>
    <Text style={styles.link}>Sign Up</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
</Link>

// New working code
const navigateToSignup = () => {
  router.push('/auth/signup');
};

// ...

<TouchableOpacity onPress={navigateToSignup}>
  <Text style={styles.link}>Sign Up</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

## Challenges Faced

### Expo Router Navigation
The most significant challenge was implementing a proper navigation structure using Expo Router. We encountered several TypeScript errors related to route path definitions:

```typescript
// Example error
Type '"auth"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'RelativePathString | ExternalPathString...'
```

These errors occurred because Expo Router has a specific way of handling route paths and requires adherence to its path pattern system. Although parts of the app function correctly, some navigation paths required explicit router usage rather than the Link component.

### Authentication State Management
Designing a robust authentication state management system required careful planning. We decided to use React Context to manage the global auth state, which allows components to access user data and authentication methods throughout the app.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Expo Router Path Patterns
Expo Router requires specific path patterns for navigation. Instead of using the Link component with relative paths, sometimes it's more reliable to use direct router navigation with absolute paths.

The navigation to signup screen issue highlights the importance of thoroughly testing all navigation paths in the app, even when TypeScript errors might suggest that the code should work.

### 2. Authentication Flow
We learned that implementing a proper authentication flow requires:
- A global state management system
- Secure storage of user credentials
- Proper route protection
- Handling of loading states
- Ensuring all navigation paths between authentication screens work correctly

### 3. Form Validation
Client-side validation is crucial for improving user experience, but we must always validate data on the server side as well. Our implementation includes both approaches.

### 4. API Integration
Working with external APIs requires proper error handling and response parsing. Our implementation handles API errors gracefully and provides meaningful feedback to users.

## Next Steps

### 1. User Role Identification and Management
- Enhance signup process to allow users to select their role (farmer or consumer)
- Update authentication context to include user role information
- Implement role-based routing and UI components
- Modify relevant screens to adapt based on user role

### 2. Farmer Profile Completion
- Implement farmer profile creation upon first login for users with farmer role
- Allow users to enter key details: farmer name, farm name, and location
- Create UI flows specific to farmer onboarding

### 3. Product Management
- Create screens for farmers to list their produce
- Implement CRUD operations for product management
- Add image upload functionality for product pictures
- Ensure proper role validation before allowing product creation

### 4. Consumer Interface
- Develop product browsing screens
- Implement search functionality by farmer/farm name and location
- Create product detail pages that show complete farmer/farm information

### 5. Multilingual Support
- Add Telugu language support
- Implement language toggle between Telugu-only and English-Telugu mixed mode

### 6. Fix Remaining TypeScript Navigation Errors
- Research and implement proper Expo Router path patterns for all navigation
- Resolve all remaining TypeScript errors related to navigation

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Refactor Authentication Logic
- Add session expiration handling
- Enhance authentication with role-based access control
- Update API calls to include proper role validation

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Implement a comprehensive RBAC system throughout the application
- Create middleware/guards to protect farmer-specific routes
- Develop UI components that adapt based on user role
- Create helper functions to check permissions for specific actions

### 3. Enhanced Form Validation
- Add more sophisticated validation for all input fields
- Implement visual feedback for form errors

### 4. Offline Support
- Add offline capabilities to allow basic app functionality without internet
- Implement data synchronization when connection is restored

## Conclusion
The Online Raithu Bazaar application has made significant progress with the implementation of the authentication system and basic navigation structure. With the recent fix for the signup navigation issue, the authentication flow is now working properly, providing a solid foundation for implementing the core features.

The next phase will focus on enhancing the authentication system with role identification for farmers and consumers, followed by developing the tailored interfaces for each role. With proper execution and role-based access control, this platform has the potential to transform how local agricultural products are marketed and sold, bringing benefits to both farmers and consumers.
