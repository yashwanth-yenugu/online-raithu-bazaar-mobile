# TypeScript (Expo)

# TypeScript Mobile Development with Expo

## Code Style and Structure
- **Naming Conventions**: Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components and types.
- **TypeScript Usage**: Leverage TypeScript's type system for better code safety and maintainability.
- **Syntax and Formatting**: Follow consistent formatting rules using Prettier and ESLint.

## UI and Styling
- **Safe Area Management**: Ensure UI components respect device safe areas using `react-native-safe-area-context`.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize UI rendering with `React.memo` and `useMemo`.

## Navigation
- Use `@react-navigation` for seamless navigation between screens.
- Implement deep linking for better user experience.

## State Management
- Use `React Context` or `Redux` for global state management.
- Prefer `useReducer` for complex state logic.

## Error Handling and Validation
- Implement error boundaries to catch runtime errors.
- Use `try/catch` blocks for asynchronous operations.

## Security
- Implement secure storage using `expo-secure-store`.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

## Internationalization (i18n)
- Use `i18next` for managing multiple languages.
- Store translations in JSON files for easy maintenance.

## Key Conventions
- Follow Expo's best practices for Views, Blueprints, and Extensions.
- Refer to Expo's official documentation for detailed guidelines.

For more detailed information, refer to [Expo's documentation](mdc:https:/docs.expo.dev).

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
- eCommerce MVP mobile app serving both farmers and consumers with the following features:

## Farmer Registration & Profile Management:
- Prompt new farmer users on first login to enter key details: farmer name, farm name, and location (e.g., village name).
- Store these details in their profile, with options for future updates.

## Farmer Dashboard:
- Enable farmers to list, manage, and update their produce.
- Include screens for tracking orders, viewing product listings, and monitoring sales history with revenue charts.

## Consumer Interface:
- Allow consumers to browse and purchase products.
- Unique Selling Proposition (USP): Enable product searches by farmer/farm name and location.
- Display complete farmer/farm data on each product detail page, enhancing transparency and trust.

## Multilingual Support:
- Target the Telugu-speaking market by offering language toggle options:
Telugu-only mode.
- English-Telugu mixed mode, where both languages are displayed to help educate farmers on product names in English.

This app is designed to empower farmers by streamlining the selling process, while also providing consumers with a rich, transparent buying experience.
